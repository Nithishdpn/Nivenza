## 🤖 How Google's Sitelinks Algorithm Works

### **The Truth About Sitelinks:**

### **Google's Algorithm Considers:**

1. **Site Structure & Navigation** (40% weight)
   - Clear, hierarchical site structure
   - Consistent navigation across all pages
   - Descriptive link text (anchor text)
   - Internal linking patterns

2. **Schema Markup** (30% weight) ✅ **YOU'VE DONE THIS**
   - SiteNavigationElement schema
   - BreadcrumbList schema
   - Organization schema
   - WebSite schema

3. **User Behavior** (20% weight)
   - Which pages users click most often
   - Time spent on pages
   - Bounce rates
   - Click-through rates from search results

4. **Content Quality** (10% weight)
   - Unique, valuable content on each page
   - Clear page titles and headings
   - Relevant keywords
   - Page authority and backlinks
